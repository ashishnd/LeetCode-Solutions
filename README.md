# LeetCode-Solutions

Purpose of this Repository - 
In this repository, I post Leetcode problems solved by me on the given day on a daily basis to showcase my coding skills and keep a track of the solved leetcode problems.

Structure of this Repository - 
There is a main problems folder in which there are sub-folders for each category of leetcode problem like for eg. Arrays, Strings, Linked list, Stack, Queue, etc. and within each of these folders there are 3 sub-folders name Easy, Medium and Hard signifying the difficulty level of the problems and within these folder are the files of the actual problems named in this format problemNumber_problemName.filetype.
